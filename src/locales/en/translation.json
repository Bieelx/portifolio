  "about_text": "I'm Gabriel, an Information Systems student at FIAP driven by technology. Currently, I'm interning at Claro, diving into the universe of Digital Analytics using Google Analytics and AWS.\n\nMy journey is marked by versatility: although my focus today is data intelligence, I have a solid background and a genuine passion for Design and Front-end. I like to combine analytical precision with visual creativity, using technologies like React, Python, and SQL to create complete solutions.\n\nOutside of work, my routine is fueled by lots of coffee and sports. In my free time, I swap the keyboard for Muay Thai gloves, train at the gym, or catch up on reading. I believe that the discipline of sports directly reflects my desire to evolve and solve problems creatively.",
