  "about_text": "I'm Gabriel: a future systems analyst from FIAP, an enthusiast of beautiful interfaces, and currently immersed in the world of data at Claro.\n\nMy journey began with code and automation (React, Python, UiPath), but today my professional focus is on Digital Analytics and AWS. I like to think I bridge the best of both worlds: the precision of data analysis with the aesthetic eye of someone who loves Front-end and Design.\n\nLifestyle: I'm that \"chill nerd\" who doesn't give up on an active life. If I'm not coding or analyzing metrics, I'm definitely holding a cup of coffee, training hard at the gym, or on the Muay Thai mats. I value balance, whether it's binge-watching something interesting, reading, or enjoying time with my girlfriend.\n\nMy goal? To create innovative solutions without losing lightness and commitment to constant evolution.",
